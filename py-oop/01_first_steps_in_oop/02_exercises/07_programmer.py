'''
TASK:
Create a class called Programmer. Upon initialization, it should receive name (string), language (string), skills 
(integer). The class should have two methods:
watch_course(course_name, language, skills_earned)
If the programmer's language is the same as the one on the course, increase his skills with the given amount and return 
a message "{name} watched {course_name}".
Otherwise return "{name} does not know {language}".
change_language(new_language, skills_needed) 
If the programmer has the skills and the new language is not the same as his, change his language to the new one and 
return "{name} switched from {previous_language} to {new_language}".
If the programmer has the skills, but the given language is equal to his return "{name} already knows {language}".
In the last case, the programmer does not have enough skills, so return "{name} needs {needed_skills} more skills" and 
do not change his language.'''
